            <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep notifications on</strong> – You'll never miss a visitor or delivery</li>
                <li><strong>Adjust motion zones</strong> – Reduce false alerts from cars or passersby (adjust in Ring app settings)</li>
                <li><strong>Charge regularly</strong> – If battery-powered, charge every few months (you'll get low-battery alerts)</li>
                <li><strong>Share with family</strong> – Add family members in the Ring app so everyone can answer the door</li>
                <li><strong>Use "Do Not Disturb"</strong> – Pause notifications during quiet hours (like nighttime)</li>

            <h2>Common Questions</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I don't hear the doorbell ring inside my house?</h3>
                <p>You can buy a Ring Chime (a plug-in device) that rings inside your home when someone presses the doorbell. It's about $30 and super easy to set up.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I see the video on my computer?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Go to <strong>ring.com</strong> and log in with your account. You can view live video and recordings from any web browser.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if my Wi-Fi is slow?</h3>
                <p>Ring needs good Wi-Fi to work well. If your doorbell is far from your router, consider a Wi-Fi extender or mesh system.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need a subscription?</h3>
                <p>No! You can see live video and answer the door for free. A Ring Protect subscription ($4/month) adds video recording history and extra features.</p>
