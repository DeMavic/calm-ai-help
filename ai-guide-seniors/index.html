            <p class="intro">
                AI (Artificial Intelligence) might sound complicated, but it's really just a helpful tool—like having a very smart assistant who can answer questions, help you find information, and make everyday tasks easier.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                You might already be using AI without knowing it! If you've ever asked Siri a question, used Google to search for something, or talked to Alexa, you've used AI.
